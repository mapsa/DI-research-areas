\section{Biomedical Image Processing}

Image processing and computer vision techniques have evolved into valuable
tools for faster and improved interpretation of biomedical images.
We are developing computer algorithms based on machine learning, variational
methods, and topological techniques for the analysis of digitized histological
samples.

Specifically, we are analyzing immunohistochemistry-stained tissue images
(IHC-images) obtained through whole-slide imaging (WSI) scanners, in order to
dentify and quantify specific marker proteins.
WSI scanners are fundamental for the acquisition of high quality and resolution
tissue images, and thanks to the collaboration between SCIAN Lab (Medicine Faculty,
University of Chile) and CCTVal-UTFSM (Centro Científico Tencnológico de
Valparaíso), we will have access to a WSI scanner,  which will allow us to improve
the image processing algorithms in digital pathology area.

Since processing images is a computationally heavy task,
considering the large dimensions and amount of pixel analysis,
is that our group is using High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques
and tools to extract complex features from large datasets of images,
as well as training machine learning algorithms are highly demanding in terms
of computation time, storage capacity and network bandwidth.

Therefore the use of HPC is fundamental for the handling of biomedical big data
and the large scale medical image computing.
