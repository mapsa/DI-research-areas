\section{Machine Learning}

The importance of studying machine learning comes from the complexity of the
data-driven world in which we currently live. With the explosion of the
internet, the social networks and the spread of an ubiquitous model of
connectivity, more and more complex data need to be analyzed: from web traffic
statistics and electronic commerce data, to digital collections of images,
video, music, and of course text.

Our INCA group has made contributions in several machine learning sub-fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ensemble Learning:} Multiple models, such as classifiers or regressors, are combined to solve a machine learning problem. In other words, ensembles combine a set of predictors to hopefully form a stronger hypothesis. Some research publications in this fields are \cite{NanculefVAM06}, \cite{ValleSAMF10}, \cite{FernandezVSA12} and \cite{NanculefVAM12}. Specifically for unbalanced data, we have proposed two ensemble techniques with asymmetric cost: \cite{NanculefVAM07} and \cite{OrmenoRVAA12}
\item \textbf{SVM and Kernel Methods:}
\item \textbf{Distributed Learning:}
\end{itemize}
