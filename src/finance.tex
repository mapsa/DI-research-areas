\section{Computational Finances}

Since in finance a huge amount of information is required to be processed,
forecasting methods need to be fast enought in order to get quick responses.
Therefore, we are interested in financial time series forecasting using machine
learning algorithms such as online learning methods which allow to reduce
execution times by taking account only relevant past data and updating the model
by aggregating new information instead of calculate everything from scratch. 

Our main topics of interests related to this area are:

\begin{itemize}
\item High frequency trading
\item Time series and volatility forecasting
\item Online machine learning algorithms
\item Econometric models: VAR, VECM
\item High performance computing
\end{itemize}
